SNCF (Société Nationale des Chemins de fer Français) is the French national railway company and the main rail operator in [France](/country/france "France"). It operates almost all long-distance and regional trains in France.

## Summary

- Reservations are always required for long-distance trains (`TGV` inOui and Intercités).
- FIP discounts are not valid on OUIGO trains.
- Some suburban trains in Paris can be used under special conditions.
- Global fares apply for international long-distance trains.
- FIP discounts also apply on SNCF buses (except long-distance buses).

## Validity of FIP Tickets

{{< fip-validity type="fip-coupon" status="valid" >}}

{{< fip-validity type="fip-reduced-ticket" status="valid" subtitle="FIP 50 / FIP 75" >}}

{{< fip-validity type="fip-global-fare" status="valid" text="For international `TGV` trains" disable_dialog=true >}}

FIP Coupons and FIP 50 / FIP 75 Tickets are valid on SNCF services. For cross-border journeys on local trains, either a continuous FIP 50 / FIP 75 Ticket or FIP Coupons for both countries are required. For international long-distance services (`TGV` or `ICE`), global fares apply (see [International TGV inOui / ICE trains](#international-tgv-inoui--ice-trains)).

## Train Categories and Reservations

Reservations are mandatory on all `TGV`, almost all `IC` trains, and some regional trains (`TER`). FIP is not valid on OUIGO trains. For trains requiring reservations, the FIP 50 / FIP 75 Ticket price always includes a reservation.

{{< highlight confusion >}}

Within France and Switzerland, FIP discounts apply as usual. FIP discounts do not apply to cross-border journeys; instead, regular fare tickets must be purchased. [^6]

International `TGV` and `ICE` trains are reservation-required in the French section. In Germany, reservations are not required and FIP Coupons are valid.

For journeys within France, the standard domestic `TGV` reservation fees apply. International journeys require a cross-border reservation:

|                        | 1st class | 2nd class |
| ---------------------- | --------- | --------- |
| Within France Off-peak | €2        | €2        |

For the direct trains between Frankfurt (Main) and Bordeaux in July and August, DB does not sell FIP 50 / FIP 75 Tickets for the journey within France. However, using them with an FIP Coupon and an SNCF reservation is possible. [^5]

Some `TGV` trains run from Paris to Freiburg and are operated entirely by SNCF, including within Germany. Only SNCF is listed as the operator for these trains, see [Identify train operators and search connections](/country/germany#fip-information). On these trains, DB Coupons and national travel concessions for DB employees are not valid in Germany. Instead, SNCF FIP Global Fare tickets can be purchased.

### Trains in Greater Paris

Île-de-France Mobilités (ÎDF Mobilités) coordinates various transport operators in Greater Paris, including RATP and SNCF.

RATP operates the Paris Métro, bus lines, and part of the RER network. SNCF operates the rest of the RER network. FIP discounts do not apply on RATP services.

{{% train-category

    title="RER trains"
    type="regional"
    fip_accepted=partially

- RER Line A – only branches A3 & A5 west of Nanterre Préfecture to Poissy or Cergy-le-Haut
- RER Line B – only branches B3 & B5 north of Gare du Nord to Aéroport Charles de Gaulle or Mitry-Claye
- RER Line C – entire line
- RER Line D – entire line
- RER Line E – entire line

Note: For journeys between Gare du Nord and Châtelet – Les Halles, only SNCF-operated RER Line D can be used. FIP discounts are not valid on RATP-operated RER Line B on the same section.

Access to some stations is restricted by ticket barriers. When using FIP Coupons, a temporary access pass is required, see [Ticket barriers](#ticket-barriers).

#### Ticket barriers

{{% float-image
    src="contramarquedePassage.webp"
    alt="Contramarque de Passage"
    width="60%"
    position="right"
%}}
Discounted FIP tickets for `RER` and Transilien trains can be purchased at Transilien ticket counters. When using these services with an SNCF FIP Coupon, a free _Contremarque de Passage_ (temporary access card) must be collected at the Transilien ticket counter for each journey. Usually, only a few are issued at a time.
{{% /float-image %}}

{{% highlight important %}}
Many stations with ticket barriers are not staffed. While there are help intercoms, they work unreliably. Without the _Contremarque de Passage_ (temporary access card), there is often no way to gain access to the stations.
{{% /highlight %}}

### Rail Replacement Buses

On rail replacement buses, FIP discounts apply when they replace a train on which FIP would have been valid.

## Recommendations

{{% highlight tip %}}
SNCF is not the easiest railway company for FIP, as reservations are often required. It is recommended to plan journeys at least a few days in advance, as trains may be fully booked. However, SNCF is known for fast connections from Paris in all directions, e.g. the 406 km journey between Paris and Strasbourg takes only about 1 hour and 45 minutes.
